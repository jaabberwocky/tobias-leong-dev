Senior Software Engineering Manager by day: I lead teams, predominantly on the frontend, on building a SaaS product at scale... that's about it.

I *kid* - I spend time building side projects (check out the blog!) and various sports:
1. Running (ran a marathon in 2022!)
2. [Muay Thai](https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/4-day-work-week-in-fnb-recharge-fridays-in-tech-how-companies-are-redefining-the-future-of-work.html)
3. Football - I play recreationally and serve as a [FAS referee](https://www.fas.org.sg/referees/) too
