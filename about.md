Senior Software Engineering Manager by day: I lead teams, predominantly on the frontend, on building a SaaS product at scale... that's about it.

I _kid_ - I spend time building side projects (check out the blog!) and various sports:

1. Running:
   - Ran a marathon in 2022!
2. Muay Thai:
   - Featured in the [Straits Times](https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/4-day-work-week-in-fnb-recharge-fridays-in-tech-how-companies-are-redefining-the-future-of-work.html) in 2022!
3. Football:
   - I play recreationally
   - Serve as a [Class 3 FAS referee](https://www.fas.org.sg/referees/) too
